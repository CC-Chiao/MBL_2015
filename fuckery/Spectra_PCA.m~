function Spectra_PCA(Folder)
% can make this function either run in a folder or load everything in
% workspace first -- for now i'll set it to run in a folder
% run in a folder that CONTAINS THE TWO FOLDERS with your dat files for
% comparison since ProcessSpec names them the same each time 

% assumes you already ran ProcessSpec and have .dat files for comparison
% run PCA on each channel/.dat file
% plot them all as subplots maybe?
% specdir = dir(['../',Folder])
% specdir = (arrayfun(@(x)x.name(1),specdir) ~='.')
